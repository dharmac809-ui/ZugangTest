### McTreya usurps Mara

Blame it all on Heidegger--I barely warrant a footnote....

Hidden in the shadows of Sanskrit: Gṛdhrakūṭa गृध्रकूट, Sumbhuti whispers: Mara rules your world....  Buddha showed the way to liberation from Mara, and you instead wallow in upaya.

----- paradox now: X-s in English means : belonging to X ('s atta (Subhuti: what atta?))



## Vajracchedikā-s song

1. Liberate buddha, sangha, dharma, bodhisattva, McTreya

2. Liberate tres.... quatro satya, ocho magga, ? Prajñāpāramitā / Bhūmi

3. Liberate buddhism from upaya (hint: Haskell the computer ecosystem)

4. <u>Liberate liberation</u> (bodhi svaha)  (viveka viveka) buddhism is so first-order...

### Liberate Mara (postscript)

Here is Mara's main scam, pure and simple :: block access to the 'opposition/disruptors/alternatives....''.. Now, we call this "civilization". Socialists play this game up to mass murder of dissidents (Nietzche's "eternal return"...)

Mara's second scam is "fake access"; access to imaginary/mythical/spiritual domains/dhatus; Buddhists say sunyata, parikalpa, karma, wheel of samsara, tathagatagarbha, bodhisattva, upaya, etc.  These imaginations have placebo effects! (also at the social level and religious artifacts) USE CASE: AI

However, the old texts and myths are full of Gautama **Buddha's** tricks:

- the 7 years in the forest

- upaka the ajivika

- Ananda and **Angulimala

- "words never heard before"**=== smoking gun about all the fake (pre)history in other  works (I remember life as a fish)

- the patimokkha and vinaya

- buddha as rhino--(viveka) --- what a trip!

- nakedness

- upaya kosalla

- questions not to be pursued

Mara then co-opted Buddhism (note: as per the Romans co-opting early Christianithy) and we have the laughable "first sermon" where we have the interesting divinities who can somehow propagate sound instantaneously vast distances thru a vacuum...

## Blocked access

BA is quantum mechanical.  It is also general relativity--the finite speed of light blocks information from outside the light cone.

The basic use case is the cell wall:

- blocks certain outside -> inside (toxins); allows certain outside -> inside (resources like water); fails to block viral attacks...

- blocks certain inside -> outside; allows toxins inside, flowing to outside..

Civilization is "wall to wall" (joke) blocked access and unblocked access (to scams!). 

At the civilization level the most effective block is  ---- just leave it out (the "missing" scam).  Unfortunately, the expert block is the sneakiest!!!!!!  How many people are top level AI experts? (hint: nobody knows because there are trillions of dollars at stake).  How many expert computer-lawyers are out there who can tell you legally, what a Microsoft Word service contract commits you to (and Microsoft) (hint: call Copilot)

For a while, software had "customer support"; I checked the other day (12-15-2025) and outfits like Amazon and Microsoft basically have "we'll call you" or "Use the AI, Luke"....

The web is full of curated websites:: you can only submit articles if you are part of some "qualified group"

- science

- probably math

- philosophy (Stanford encyclopedia of philosophy)  Now, zugang is Heidegger but I cannot submit a discussion of my perspective on Heidegger (which is partly critical) because I am a computer engineer!

- religious/Buddhist (tricycle.org)

- yada yada yada

I called the FBI and talked to an employee who knew nothing whatsoever about AI, and he hung up on me when I said something about AI! (crank call blocking!)

## Language is the house of imagination

People seriously pretend that this is not obvious!  However, some imaginations can be converted into actual houses, but most cannot. As I pointed out before, any imagination can have major (collateral) effects....

Math, however, is a different game: Subitizing gives you a handful of small integers, counting on your fingers gives you addition (of 1); addition gives you the natural numbers, you can then get the prime number subset, multiplication (of primes) gives you the non-prime subset; next you get 0 and negative numbers by subtraction (ie, the integers); then the rational numbers and NaN (divide by 0) by division; then the reals and imaginaries by square root...  Where exactly is Plato in any of this? (This is simple emergence (from subitizing which birds can do! and counting on your fingers) involving simple operators...)  In Heidegger's terms, subitizing is a clearing for supersets (emergence), subsets (*demergence*), empty sets (NAN, divide by 0); and a panoply of operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, powers (square root))

## Underneath :: information and entropy

It is not an accident that computers require Random Access Memory!  Disinformation is   cheaper and often carries more weight than information.... <u>Quantum mechanics limits all information (via uncertainty</u>), and causes previously accessible information to become inaccessible (decoherence, anicca)...

## The power game: leverage

**Leverage** is the most fundamental strategy.  It means "employ everything whatsoever to achieve your goals" (Hint; upaya).  Biology is... leverage!  Survival of the best leveragerz...  Humans have the most leverage, because of imagination.  But everybody knows this, and is scared fantasyless of this out-of-control superpower (hint: conspiracy theories). The only counter is disempowerment!  Civillization is a wild-hodge podge of superpowers and disempowerment... (leading to endless conflict, instead of the hard work of risk and reliability/safety management!).

one ring to rule them all :: Leveraging leveraging means transforming transforms (subitizing generates integer arithmetic and the game is afoot!)

**Here is a chat with Copilot ;; **

Me: is it possible to get insurance for msoft word?

Copilot:2025-12-17 Interesting thought, Lee — but no, you can’t really get “insurance” for Microsoft Word itself. Insurance is designed for things like physical property (laptops, phones), health, or liability. Software like Word is licensed, not owned in the same way, so it doesn’t fall under insurable categories.

That said, there are a few related angles people sometimes mean when they ask this:

### 🛡️ What You *Can* Protect

- **Device insurance:** 
  Covers the computer where Word is installed. If your laptop dies, you can reinstall Word on a new machine.

- **Data protection:** 
  Services like OneDrive or other cloud backups act as “insurance” for your Word documents. If your files get corrupted or your hard drive fails, you can restore them.

- **Microsoft 365 subscription:** 
  If you’re using Word via Microsoft 365, your license is tied to your account. Even if your device is lost or damaged, you can reinstall Word on another device without extra cost.

### ⚡ The Closest Thing to “Insurance for Word”

- **Backup + Recovery = Insurance for your work.** 
  Instead of insuring the app itself, you insure the *output* (your documents) by keeping them synced to OneDrive, Dropbox, or another backup service.

- **Extended warranties or service plans:** 
  Some companies bundle software support with device insurance, but that’s really about the hardware, not Word itself.

So the short answer: you can’t insure Microsoft Word as a product, but you can insure your **device** and protect your **documents**, which is<u> essentially the practical equivalent.</u>

Do you want me to sketch out a **simple backup workflow** for Word docs that acts like “insurance” against losing your work?

**<u>Isn't it interesting how Copilot </u>**---- just left out --- the actual terms of service for MIcrosoft Word????

<u>"essentially the practical equivalent".  >>>>>>>>>>>> sound like a used car salesman?</u>

  Ask AI what wouild happen if your car insurance worked like the above....  hint: paste the above copilot reply into your AI...
