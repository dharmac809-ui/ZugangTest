Hidden in the shadows of Sanskrit: Gṛdhrakūṭa गृध्रकूट, somebhuti whispers: Mara rules your world....  Buddha showed the way to liberation from Mara, and you instead kiss Mara's ass....

Here is Mara's main scam, pure and simple :: block access to the 'opposition/disruptors/alternatives....''.. Now, we call this "civilization". Socialists play this game up to mass murder of dissidents (Nietzche's "eternal return"...)

Mara's second scam is "fake access"; access to imaginary/mythical/spiritual domains/dhatus; Buddhists say sunyata, parikalpa, karma, wheel of samsara, tathagatagarbha, bodhisattva, upaya, etc.  These imaginations have placebo effects!

However, the old texts and myths are full of Gautama **Buddha's** tricks:

- the 7 years in the forest

- upaka the ajivika

- Ananda and **Angulimala

- "words never heard before"**=== smoking gun about all the fake (pre)history in later works (I remember life as a fish)

- the patimokkha and vinaya

- buddha as rhino--(viveka) --- what a trip!

- nakedness

- upaya kosalla

- questions not to be pursued

Mara then co-opted Buddhism (note: as per the Romans co-opting early Christianithy) and we have the laughable "first sermon" where we have the interesting divinities who can somehow propagate sound instantaneously vast distances thru a vacuum...
