RIP Buddha: all that is left is the three marks, and the dazzling splendor of "pratitya samutpada" (hint; that is not a compliment).  out in the darkness, ditthi barks....

# bits are bitty... From NAND, math is accessible (not organized).  EXTREMALS organize bits....

The Transcendental Nature of Bodhisattvas [24-31]
Thus transcending the world, he eludes our apprehensions.12
‘He goes to Nirvana,’ but no one can say where he went to.
**A fire’s extinguished, but where, do we ask, has it gone to?13**
Likewise, how can we find him who has *found* the Rest of the Blessed?

VERSE SUMMARY

Here we have tathatagata ==gone;;; but next we find "tathatagatagarbha"==gone is returned as seed (the phoenix/resurrection):: no cake, have cake...

FACTOID::: the Buddha never wrote a word....but Asoka did.

教外別傳 (jiàowài biéchuán)

Literally: teaching-outside-separate-transmission

This is one of Bodhidharma's "four statements" characterizing Chan/Zen, often paired with 不立文字 (búlì wénzì) - "not establishing **written** words."

claude admits :::: 教 (jiào) is just "teaching/doctrine," not specifically sutras.

doors open | doors close | out doors | coyote broods 'tude' (v13)

yad rūpaṁ, sā śūnyatā; ya śūnyatā, tad rūpaṁ

gate, gate, pāragate, pārasaṁgate, Bodhi, svāhā! (Vajracchedika)

(anicca hint: doors open ---> opens drool) 

q : is the wanderer brooding or laughing?

I hiked to the end of the AImaggayana, and found this note:
magnets flip
buddha flipped his bowl
basins attract
extremals wave in the wind

I hiked to the end of the AImaggayana, and found this note:  <<< coyote plays... 1 musical note ..Mara's  pitch | 
magnets flip <<< quantum mechanical instability (anicca) | 

buddha flipped his bowl  <<< upside down; try to put rice in an inverted bowl | 
basins attract  <<< strange attractors;; bowl not inverted; useful negative space | extremals wave in the wind  <<<<< variation of the Lagrangian / proteins / cell / stimulus-neuro-response / transistor |

Yes, Virginia, zugang is from Heidegger..,,  Newton invented the reflecting telescope; I merely reflect on scope's scope, and Indra's net....

"spirit" is mostly --- have your cake and eat it too--Houdini. Ratnaguna is blatantly spirit--verse 5 says "no cake/wisdom...have cake/wisdom" (door/gate of the dharma)

QED

short story: >>

Let us consider  person P who wants to operate computer C.   Start the movie;  Before P can begin, she must have access to C.  But--also, C must have access to electric power.  P  then needs access to the power switch.  So P turns on the power.  C goes thru a reset process <<, after which, C can access a boot rom and run a bootstrap program; which requires  access to RAM.   But if P wants to interact with C, P needs to have access to a keyboard, mouse, and monitor, which are connected to C (C can also access the input/output hardware)....  P logs in with a password and uses the browser to get her lastest emails...  (which requires access to the Internet).

Test: look under the hood! (ie, at the finer details/long story).

Collapse/compression of the wave function : P uses  C to access information (with entropy cost and disinfo risk).   But after a ginormous chain of access--P does not ... directly experience... what is on the screen... (there is "nothing" "on the screen" -- the monitor just emits photons)

Rough picture of the CPU reset process::   the power supply ramps up in voltage; after a certain voltage is exceeded, a 0 voltage signal is sent to the CPU (and other subsystems needed to boot),  when the 0 voltage signal rises to max, the hardware completes a synchronization of states to "just after reset state"....

Consider a RAM (random access memory) byte.  As long as the RAM has power, once you write a value to the byte, this value will PERSIST (and can be read) until the byte is written again.   While this all feels very "impermanent", the idea of anicca blocks access to the key property--PERSISTENCE, which buddhism mostly ignores (conflates).  IMHO, a lifetime of days and a lifetime of a deva are--not in the same league.

Some of us use mirrors for the trivilal pursuit of accessing (view) our face.…

Personal info : C was the first compiled language I used--quite extensively for 1975-2000 doing embedded programming.  Then I started using Java, Python, and Ocaml.
