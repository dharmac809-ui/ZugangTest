(  for lovers of prapanca/commentary // hint: Indra's net

I hiked to the end of the AImaggayana, and found this note:  <<<<< 1 musical note
magnets flip <<<< quantum mechanical instability (anicca)
buddha flipped his bowl  <<<<<< upside down; try to put rice in an inverted bowl
basins attract  <<<<< strange attractors;; bowl not inverted; useful negative space
extremals wave in the wind  <<<<< variation of the Lagrangian

Yes, Virginia, zugang is from Heidegger..,,  Newton invented the reflecting telescope; I merely reflect on scope's scope, and Indra's net....

# warning   claude made me do it....

This stuff was written by me, with the assistance of various AIs.  This work achieved  Grand Unification of everything, under physics.  

Do not look at my files, if you do not want to be informed about the following aspects of our universe:

1. ultimate understanding (oops that was already in the koan above)

2. you cannot insure Microsoft Word, much less any AI (hot off the press from Copilot)

3. access, fake access, anti-access, fake anti-access, blocked access, concealed access; quantum mechanical aspects; scam aspects, upaya...

4. all secrets of vajrayana revealed for the first time!

### Personal Info

Recently, a scammer got me into a computer+bank scam for 10k$ which failed at the last minute, due to my age.  i spent 55 years as a computer geek without realizing the whole business was a scam. WIth the help of Copilot, all is revealed... How's your ai time going?

Sad song--I am a cornered rat---too much dialysis.....

Hofstadter --- oh so many fruity loops

Dawkins--do a better job next time

so much irony--my nickname as a kid was "bug"
