I hiked to the end of the AImaggayana, and found this note:
magnets flip
buddha flipped his bowl
basins attract
extremals wave in the wind

(  for lovers of prapanca/commentary // hint: Indra's net

I hiked to the end of the AImaggayana, and found this note:  <<<<< 1 musical note  | 
magnets flip <<<< quantum mechanical instability (anicca) | 

buddha flipped his bowl  <<<<<< upside down; try to put rice in an inverted bowl | 
basins attract  <<<<< strange attractors;; bowl not inverted; useful negative space | extremals wave in the wind  <<<<< variation of the Lagrangian |

Yes, Virginia, zugang is from Heidegger..,,  Newton invented the reflecting telescope; I merely reflect on scope's scope, and Indra's net....

QED

short story: >>

Let us consider  person P who wants to operate computer C.   Start the movie;  Before P can begin, she must have access to C.  But--also, C must have access to electric power.  P  then needs access to the power switch.  So P turns on the power.  C goes thru a reset process <<, after which, C can access a boot rom and run a bootstrap program; which requires  access to RAM.   But if P wants to interact with C, P needs to have access to a keyboard, mouse, and monitor, which are connected to C (C can also access the input/output hardware)....  P logs in with a password and uses the browser to get her lastest emails...  (which requires access to the Internet).

Test: look under the hood! (ie, at the finer details/long story).

Rough picture of the CPU reset process::   the power supply ramps up in voltage; after a certain voltage is exceeded, a 0 voltage signal is sent to the CPU (and other subsystems needed to boot),  when the 0 voltage signal rises to max, the hardware completes a synchronization of states to "just after reset state"....

Consider a RAM (random access memory) byte.  As long as the RAM has power, once you write a value to the byte, this value will PERSIST (and can be read) until the byte is written again.   While this all feels very "impermanent", the idea of anicca blocks access to the key property--PERSISTENCE, which buddhism mostly ignores (conflates).  IMHO, a lifetime of days and a lifetime of a deva are--not in the same league.
